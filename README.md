# Home assistant weatherflow UDP component

This a UDP Sensor module grabbing data from a WeatherFlow weatherstation. This is a fork of [Home assistant weatherflow UDP component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weatherflow) made by @echo1001. It is adapted to the correct Home Assistant structure, added some translations and then I will be looking at a few other changes.

I allready did a similar sensor in [this project](https://github.com/briis/smartweatherudp), but this one is a much more professional implementation, so I want to see if I can add what I need to this module.
